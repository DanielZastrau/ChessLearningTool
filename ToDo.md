* implement a delete function
* I also should implement a change function, which gets a move sequence and a color, and then the first move of the specified color, which is not in the repertoire, deletes the entire subtree that is present and sets a new node.
* Implement a check which checks if the provided move sequence for the update is odd or even long and if that matches the selected color
* Do move checking
* Implement the pieces and so on
* Implement that pieces can't move through other pieces
